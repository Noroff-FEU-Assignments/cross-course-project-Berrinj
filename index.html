    <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">It's important to always improve web security, and I would advise my clients to let me in on the decision on to where they would be hosting their website. I understand how they might firstly focus on price, but I can provide more selling points like how trustworthy the hosting site is, how easy it is to get help when they need it, and then I would come up with great hosting options that will provide security for them and their users with all that and price in mind. I would advise them to let me test third-party applications and do research before implementing them to their site in any way. I would also make sure they can trust me to check every new code to be safe before pushing it into their website. I would advise my client to enable at least two-factor authentication so that the users stay safer from getting their accounts misused by a third party, and with that losing trust in the site/product/etc.</p>
